## Problem Overview

This project involves creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize Call center data. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights and key performance indicators (KPIs) to improve call center operations and decision-making processes. The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of call metrics, agent performance, and customer satisfaction.



### Steps followed 

-    Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
-   Imported the CSV file into Power BI.
-  Performed data cleaning using the Power Query Editor.
- Created various KPIs using the dataset:

    *   Total Calls- 32.94K
    *  Total Call duration in hours- 13.74K hrs
    *  Response Time in %- 75.26%
    *  Total Call duration in minutes- 824.22K min
    *  Average Call duration in minutes- 25.02 min

- Created different charts like Bar charts and Donut charts.

### Technologies Used

     Power BI: Main tool for creating and publishing the interactive dashboard.

     DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for creating calculated columns and measures 
                                       to derive meaningful insights.

     Power Query: For data transformation and preparation before visualization.

     GitHub: To manage project versions, documentation, dashobard and code.

## Insights


#### Here are some important insights from the dashboard:


   ðŸ”³ Thursdays and Fridays are the busiest days with the highest number of calls received.
   
   ðŸ”³ The Los Angeles office is the busiest among all 4 offices with 50% of calls received.

   ðŸ”³ Baltimore office has the worst performance in response time.

   ðŸ”³ Most of the calls received are related to Billing questions.

   ðŸ”³ Negative sentiment calls are received in all Call center offices.




 ## Based on these insights, I suggest the following improvements for the Call center:


        â–¶  As Thursdays and Fridays are the busiest days in the month, allocate more 
            customer representatives on these days.
        â–¶  As Response Time shows 75.26%, indicating a need for improvement to increase 
            customer satisfaction and trust.
        â–¶  Detected approx. 11K calls with negative sentiment calls, leading to a proposal 
            for company-wide workshops or training to enhance customer interaction skills 
            and reduce negative sentiment calls.
